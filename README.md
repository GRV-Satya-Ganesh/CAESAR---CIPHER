The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. 1  While it's a basic method, it's historically significant as one of the earliest known encryption techniques.
